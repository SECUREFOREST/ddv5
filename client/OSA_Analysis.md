OneSubmissiveAct (2018 Version) – Website Purpose and Overview

OneSubmissiveAct is an adult-oriented, sex-positive platform centered on consensual BDSM-themed tasks between strangers or friends.  Its homepage tagline describes it as “a safe, private space to share a photo of your sexual fantasy with a stranger or lover,” emphasizing user control over interactions ￼.  The site’s design highlights privacy and consent: for example, users create one-time links to erotic tasks that expire after 30 days ￼.  In practice, users take on dominant or submissive roles and create “acts” (requests or offers) that others can claim.  The overall theme is consensual erotic play with strict safety features (photo expiration, blocking, difficulty levels) built in ￼ ￼.  (A hidden mission note from the developers even states “Built by kinky folks, for kinky folks” ￼.)

Homepage Flow

Upon visiting the homepage, new visitors see a prominent banner: “Explore your fantasies online”.  Below that, a short description reiterates the site’s purpose as “a safe, private space to share a photo of your sexual fantasy” ￼.  The page immediately presents two calls-to-action: a “Sign up” button and a “Tell me More” link ￼. Scrolling down, there is a “Get started” section with three large buttons for the core user paths:
	•	Offer your Submission – for users who want to act as a submissive (performing tasks for a dominant) ￼.
	•	Demand and Dominate – for users who want to act as a dominant (assigning tasks for a submissive) ￼.
	•	Compete with a Switch – for users who enjoy switch play (a rock-paper-scissors game where the loser performs the other’s demand) ￼.

Each option is described briefly. For example, the “Offer your Submission” blurb invites a private moment of submission and notes that the picture “is seen only by” the chosen person ￼.  Below the calls-to-action, the homepage has informational sections explaining user controls and safety: it explains that users can freely choose partners and explicitness levels ￼, that photos expire by default after 30 days (with the option to delete immediately after viewing) ￼, and that a Block button makes your content invisible to unwanted users ￼.  Another section emphasizes the five “difficulty levels” of submissive acts (from Titillating to Hardcore) to allow gradual escalation ￼.  Taken together, the homepage clearly communicates the site’s theme of consensual, user-controlled erotic exchange and guides first-time visitors to register or learn more.

Account Registration and Login

Registration: New users click Sign up and fill out a straightforward form ￼ ￼. Required fields include username, full name, email, password, and date of birth (with a dropdown calendar) ￼.  The form also asks for gender identity and “Interested in” (preferred genders) from multiple checkbox options ￼. There is an open-ended “Hard limits” text field for users to list any acts they won’t do ￼.  (A note on the page stresses that the site “isn’t a social network” and accounts aren’t publicly listed in any directory ￼.)  At the bottom is a newsletter opt-in and a link to login if you already have an account ￼.  Notably, the signup process does not explicitly ask the user to choose “Dominant” or “Submissive” as a role – instead, roles emerge from how the user engages with tasks.  After signing up, the user’s profile will track their activity as a Dom or Sub (for example, leaderboards track each side’s points) ￼.

Login: Existing users click Log in and enter their registered email or username and password ￼.  The login page is minimal: two input fields and buttons for Sign up (for new users) and Forgot password ￼.  (After login, the user sees personalized links rather than “Sign in.”)  Both signup and login pages carry a common footer and header: the header shows the site logo/name (linking to Home) and a link toggling between “Sign up” and “Sign in” as needed ￼ ￼.  The footer on every page includes text “Built by kinky folks, for kinky folks” and links to Advertise, News, Subs Leaderboard, and Doms Leaderboard ￼ ￼.

User Dashboard (After Login)

Once logged in, a user sees a personalized dashboard combining profile and task panels.  (Archive snapshots require login, so we rely on clues from the site UI.)  Each user has a profile page showing their username, avatar, and personal statistics.  For example, an archived profile (“jade”) shows a split of 46% Submissive and 54% Dominant beside a prominent [Block] button【92†】.  This suggests the profile summarizes how often the user has acted in each role and allows them to block specific members.  The header bar (visible in mobile screenshots) has icons for Home, Notifications, and Profile, along with the user’s “kred” balance (an internal credit system).  In one screenshot, the user has “0 kreds” and a link “get more kreds” at the bottom【91†】, implying that performing or creating tasks uses up these credits.

For a Submissive user, the dashboard provides a form to “Perform One Submissive Act.” This form lets the user describe what they will do (text entry) and select a difficulty level (Titillating through Hardcore) before submitting the act ￼.  A link is provided to switch if they feel more dominant.  For a Dominant user, the dashboard shows a form “Demand Their Submission.” Here the user writes a command (the act they want the sub to perform) and again selects a difficulty level ￼ ￼.  The dominant form clearly notes, “We won’t show this demand to [the submissive] unless they first consent to perform one submissive act of your choice” ￼ – reinforcing that the submissive must opt in before seeing the task.

A “Switch” user can initiate the “The Loser Submits” game.  This two-player form asks for a demand text, a difficulty level, and each player’s Rock/Paper/Scissors choice ￼ ￼.  After a draw, special rules apply (e.g. both lose, both win, or a coin flip) ￼.  These core features – creating a submissive offer, issuing a dominant demand, or starting a switch-game – are the primary interactive components of the logged-in dashboard.

Aside from task panels, the dashboard includes the user’s account controls.  Users can edit their profile (name, picture, hard limits, etc.) at /users/edit (not directly archived) and check notifications.  The profile also reminds them of site rules (e.g. continuing consent).  At the top right, the navbar displays their current kredits and notifications.  The site’s two public leaderboards (“Subs” and “Doms”) track top-performing users in each role (for example, by completed acts or karma) ￼.  Overall, the logged-in interface unifies profile info and role-specific task controls, while reinforcing privacy and safety controls at every step.

Core Features
	•	Task Creation & Assignment: The site’s heart is the creation of erotic “acts” or tasks.  As a submissive, a user clicks “Offer your Submission” to make a one-time act offer. They fill in what they will do (often by uploading or describing a photo) and select an explicitness level.  The “Perform One Submissive Act” form (archived UI) shows the five difficulty levels (Titillating, Arousing, Explicit, Edgy, Hardcore) with definitions ￼ ￼.  Once submitted, the site generates a claimable link that the user can share privately. *
		•	This mobile screenshot (from 2019) shows a user ready to share their private offer link: it cautions “Share this link very carefully – the first person to claim it can demand a titillating pic” (the text is in the image). In practice, whoever clicks that link first and consents will complete the act and upload a private photo to the original user.
As a dominant, a user clicks “Demand and Dominate” and fills out the “Demand Their Submission” form. They write the act they want performed and pick the difficulty level.  The interface notes explicitly that the submissive won’t even see the demand unless they first agree to do the dominant’s chosen submissive act ￼. This enforces double-consent: the sub must first submit themselves before seeing the dom’s request.  Once saved, this demand is also shared via a private claim link (not visible until consent).
In switch mode, a user chooses “Compete with a Switch”, which opens “The Loser Submits” game form. They enter a demand text (what the other must do if they lose) and pick a difficulty level. They also choose Rock/Paper/Scissors; their opponent does likewise.  The form explains that the loser of the game will have to perform the other’s demand ￼. This creative feature adds a competitive element to task creation.

	•	Task Tracking & Reporting: While the archived snapshots do not show a full task inbox, the workflow implies that after an act is claimed and completed (the submissive uploads a photo), both parties see it. Completed tasks likely appear in the user’s history or feed.  The presence of leaderboards suggests that each successful act earns “points” or karma. Although not explicitly documented, users probably have a way to view all their pending/accepted tasks on their dashboard.
	•	Communication/Messaging: There is no obvious public chat or forum. Instead, the site relies on private claim links as the communication mechanism: users copy and send these URLs to each other. The design implies most interaction happens off-site (e.g. via chat after claiming). The navbar does show a bell and heart icon (likely for notifications/likes), but no dedicated message system is visible in the archives.
	•	Ratings, Points, Gamification: OneSubmissiveAct incorporates gamification through leaderboards and an internal currency.  The footer links to a Subs Leaderboard and a Doms Leaderboard ￼, implying users compete for top ranks (presumably by number of tasks completed/created or by community “kudos”).  In the screenshot from [91], the user’s dashboard shows “You have 0 kreds. get more kreds,” indicating that creating acts consumes these credits (and likely completing acts earns them).  Thus, users collect and spend “kreds” to engage in the system, and the leaderboards reward the most active or highly-rated dominants and submissives.
	•	Profile Customization: During signup (and later in account settings), users fill out personal details that become their profile. Beyond basic info (username, full name, gender, orientation) ￼ ￼, profiles include an open “Hard limits” section where users list any acts they refuse to do ￼. Users can also upload a profile photo and bio (not directly archived). The profile summary, as seen in [92], displays the user’s dominance/submission balance and a Block button to hide their profile and content from specific other users. The text footer “Built by kinky folks, for kinky folks” appears on all pages ￼, reinforcing the community vibe.
	•	Community/Social Components: The site has minimal social networking beyond task sharing. There is a News section (archived) for announcements: e.g. posts about new ownership and community issues ￼. Users interact chiefly by sharing tasks; there are no public forums or feeds. However, the existence of a News page and leaderboards provides some community context. Safety reports are handled via a “feedback” page (mentioned in a news post ￼).

Navigation Structure

The site’s navigation is simple and consistent across pages.  The top bar (header) always shows the logo/name “One Submissive Act (OSA)” which links to the homepage ￼.  On logged-out pages this bar also shows a “Sign in” link (or “Sign up” link after signing in).  The primary site pages include:
	•	Home (/), which is the main landing page described above ￼.
	•	Sign Up (/users/sign_up) and Log In (/users/sign_in) for accounts ￼ ￼.
	•	Offer/Demand/Switch pages (/subs/new, /doms/new, /switches/new) for creating tasks – accessible via the homepage buttons.
	•	News page (/news) for site announcements (link in footer) ￼.
	•	Advertise page (link in footer), presumably a static info page (not captured).
	•	Subs Leaderboard and Doms Leaderboard (footer links), likely listing top users in each role.
	•	User Profile/Settings (/users/edit) for personal account settings (users reach this via their account menu).

The footer menu is identical on every page.  It contains text “Advertise with us”, “News”, “Subs Leaderboard”, and “Doms Leaderboard” ￼.  Thus the site map is flat: most pages are one click from the home page or footer.  There is no public directory of users (signup emphasizes that “your account isn’t publicly listed” ￼), and no deep page hierarchy beyond the sections above.

Terms of Service / Community Guidelines

Although no separate Terms page was captured, the site’s News posts and UI give the rules of engagement.  All interactions must be between consenting adults.  One announcement explicitly forbids harassment: it warns that verbally abusing members (e.g. encouraging suicide) violates community standards ￼.  The News entry stresses that personal beliefs must be respected so long as acts are consensual and harmless ￼. In practice, the site enforces safety by requiring email confirmation on signup and stating that accounts will be disabled for abuse ￼.  In short, community guidelines mandate respectful behavior and mutual consent: violations (harassment, hate, etc.) can lead to permanent bans ￼.

Regarding privacy and content: photos shared on the site are never public by default.  By design, each erotic image is only viewable by one private recipient.  Content expires automatically (30 days by default) ￼, and users are encouraged to delete images after viewing.  A clear block feature lets users hide all their content from any individual ￼.  These measures – along with the difficulty-level warnings and “built by kinky folks” ethos – form the core of the site’s safety/consent policy.  In summary, OneSubmissiveAct’s guidelines emphasize explicit informed consent at every step, and any non-consensual or abusive behavior is strictly prohibited ￼ ￼.
