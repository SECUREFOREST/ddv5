## 📱 **Route Access Requirements**

### **Authentication Required**
All modern UI routes require user authentication and are protected by the `PrivateRoute` component. Users must be logged in to access these routes.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Route Configuration**
All routes are configured in `client/src/App.jsx` using React Router v6:

```jsx
{/* Modern UI Component Routes */}
<Route path="/modern" element={<PrivateRoute><ModernUIDemo /></PrivateRoute>} />
<Route path="/modern/routes" element={<PrivateRoute><ModernRouteNavigation /></PrivateRoute>} />
<Route path="/modern/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute><ModernDashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
// ... additional routes
```

### **Component Loading**
Routes use React.lazy() for code splitting and dynamic imports:

```jsx
const ModernDashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./components/ModernDashboard'));
```

### **Authentication Protection**
All routes are wrapped with `PrivateRoute` component for authentication:

```jsx
<Route path="/modern/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute><ModernDashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
```
